# webtravel_258
Simple web application using Node.js and React

I've done the CRUD operations based on Travel agency.

The main part was the backend of the application

Starting the app

Open the dump file of MySql, and start the query

In VS Code open 2 terminals, first one navigate to backend directory and the other one for frontend. In both type npm start.

Warning: This application won't work if one of the requirements above is not started
